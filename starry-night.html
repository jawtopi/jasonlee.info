    <h1>Starry Night</h1>

    <p>Childhood goes by in a blur.</p>

    <p>Most of my tween years have vanished into the hazy fog of forgetfulness. But there is one night I can't stop recalling.</p>

    <p>I was jamming Pokémon White on the old Nintendo DSI, totally engrossed into that archaic little device. Until my mum told me to get a move on outside.</p>

    <p>"It's Guy Fawke's Day"</p>

    <p>Now I had – and still have – no idea who Guy Fawkes was. But like the filial and honourable son I was, I listened to her, and before I knew it, I was surrounded by people (family friends and relatives I presume) and standing in the middle of our suburb street.</p>

    <p>We lit some of those little sparkly sticks that fire off streams of light! It was absolutely wonderful. Completely sublime. If there was any word to describe it, it would be: "Magic". Complete, pure, stunning magic.</p>

    <p>Never had I ever felt more like a child. Now when I see one of those sparkly sticks, I light up with glee. My favourite fireworks are actually those golden ones that spread out in that golden dandelion shape. They burst in the same patterns the sticks sparkle.</p>

    <p>I'm no longer a child. Responsibilities pile. There're people that count on me as much as I count on them.</p>

    <p>But there's this unique sense of wonder we had as a child - when the world truly was a magical, wondrous place. When your imagination had no bounds. Where you could pretend your potatoes were potato knights and make them fight against the carrot nation.</p>

    <p>And as cliché as this is going to sound, when my dad would drive me back from karate at night, I could never stop myself from looking upwards, and gazing at the stars.</p>

    <p>They made me feel so miniscule.</p>

    <p>Small, insignificant, and so terribly in awe.</p>

    <p>For what a mysterious, terrifying, and wonderful world we live in.</p>

    <p>There are three things I will still do when I'm eighty.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>I will squat. Leg strength, posterior chain strength, and bone density become ever more important with age. The loss of mobility as an elder is the first step to degradation.</li>

        <li>I will spoil my grandchildren handsomely. And make them do a little mathematics.</li>

        <li>I will absolutely, never, ever lose my sense of child-like splendour, awe, and curiosity for the world. Nothing is ever going to rip that away from me. You can try, but dare to fail.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And every day will feel like gazing at the stars.</p>
